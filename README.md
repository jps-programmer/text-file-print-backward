# text-file-print-backward
Takes any .txt file and prints the contents in reverse.

IMPORTANT

The program requires two .txt files and is defaulted to use the name "text.txt" for the original content that needs to be reversed and "temporary.txt" to hold the reversed content. The contents of temporary.txt will then be printed to the CMD.
